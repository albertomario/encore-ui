# CSS Styleguide

## Acknowledgements:

Most of these standards are based off of the guidelines provided by [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/)
and [OOCSS](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/). Reading up
on these materials will give you a much greater understanding of why these rules were chosen.

## Basic Rules:

1. **Use class names for your selectors**

    Many style guides focus around preventing classitis by depending on HTML elements for selectors. While using only
    "semantic" HTML is a neat idea,
    [it doesn't scale well](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2011/04/28/our-best-practices-are-killing-us/).

    Therefore, use of HTML elements or id's in a selector is strongly discouraged, as they create unnecessary
    specificity. **The only time it is acceptable to use elements as selectors is when applying styles to a specific
    component (`rxApp`, `rxButton`, etc).**

    *Scenario #1*

    Use `.blog-article {}` instead of `article {}`.

    Yes, sometimes it's "uglier" to use `blog-article` as a class, but it's much more re-usable than relying on the
    specific HTML `article` element.  Along that same logic,
    [don't style heading elements](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2011/09/06/style-headings-using-html5-sections/),
    but use class names instead.

    ```html
    <h1 class="alpha">My Big Site Title</h1>
    <h2 class="alpha">My Just as Big Site Tagline</h2>
    http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/
    ```

    **The only time it is acceptable to style heading elements is when defining their base styles.**

    *Scenario #2*

    `.login-form` instead of `#login-form`

    Here, instead of using an ID, we use a class name. While there may only ever be one login form on a page, using a
    class name gives us much more flexibility for the future. **This is probably the biggest change that you'll need to
    make when coding CSS according to this style guide.**

    For a great example on how using IDs in selectors can cause major re-usability problems, take a look at the 'twitter
    widget' example in the post
    ["When using IDs can be a pain in the class..."](http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/when-using-ids-can-be-a-pain-in-the-class/)

2. **[Keep CSS selectors short](http://csswizardry.com/2012/05/keep-your-css-selectors-short/)**

    CSS selectors should have no more than 3 qualifiers.

    Since we use LESS, it's easy to create long selectors without realizing it (through too much nesting of CSS).
    As a general rule, [**don't nest selectors more than 2 deep**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhX8iPcDSsI).

3. Avoid `!important` AT ALL COSTS

    Nothing reduces the re-usability and flexibility of your CSS like using `!important`. Chances are, if you're
    finding yourself needing to use it, the CSS you're overriding is too specific and needs to be refactored using
    the previous rules.

    If you simply can't avoid using `!important`, you **MUST** include a comment adjacent to its use explaining why
    it's necessary. This comment should explain what selectors !important is overriding and why those selectors can't
    be changed to be less specific.

4. Use CSS Lint

    If the previous three rules seem too complicated or annoying to have to remember, just run your code through
    [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/#warnings=display-property-grouping,duplicate-properties,empty-rules,known-properties,text-indent,vendor-prefix,fallback-colors,star-property-hack,underscore-property-hack,bulletproof-font-face,font-faces,duplicate-background-images,regex-selectors,universal-selector,unqualified-attributes,zero-units,overqualified-elements,shorthand,floats,font-sizes,ids,important,outline-none,qualified-headings,unique-headings) when committing.

## Format

**Note**: This section inspired by [The Principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css/blob/master/README.md#format)

This code format ensures that code is easy to read, easy to clearly comment, minimizes the chance of accidentally
introducing errors, and results in useful diffs and blames.

* Line length should be no more than 120 characters.
* 4 spaces for one level of indentation. No tabs.
* Use one discrete selector per line in multi-selector rulesets.
* Include a single space before the opening brace of a ruleset.
* Include one declaration per line in a declaration block.
* Include a single space after the colon of a declaration.
* Class names not associated with a specific directive should use kebab-case format (e.g. `.this-is-a-class-name`).
* Use lowercase and longhand hex values, e.g., `#aaaaaa` as opposed to `#aaa` or `#AAAAAA`.
* Use double quotes consistently (e.g. `content: ""` or `[type="text"]`).
* Quote attribute values in selectors (e.g. `input[type="checkbox"]`).
* _Where allowed_, avoid specifying units for zero-values (e.g. `margin: 0;`).
* Include a space after each comma in comma-separated property or function values.
* Include a semi-colon at the end of the last declaration in a declaration block.
* Place the closing brace of a ruleset in the same column as the first character of the ruleset.
* Separate each ruleset by a blank line.

```css
.selector-1,
.selector-2,
.selector-3[type="text"] {
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    display: block;
    font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
    color: #333;
    background: #fff;
    background: linear-gradient(#fff, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8));
}

.selector-a,
.selector-b {
    padding: 10px;
}
```

## Class Naming

In order to create consistent class names, it's encouraged to use the naming defined
at [semantic-ui.com](http://semantic-ui.com). This is especially true for components that are meant to be re-usable
like icons or alert boxes.

## Scoping Styles to Directives

CSS selectors used to scope styles for a specific directive may differ depending on how the directive behaves.

### Element Directives

For element directives, use the element name selector.

```css
rx-field-name { ... }
rx-help-text { ... }
```

### Attribute Directives

For attribute directives that *wrap* their target element in custom markup (e.g. `rx-checkbox`, `rx-radio`,
`rx-select`), we don't have a semantic element or attribute to use for the root CSS selector.
In this case, it is best to use the angular-normalized CSS class name so that it is not confused with an element
selector (`.rxCheckbox` vs `rx-checkbox`).

```css
.rxCheckbox { ... }
.rxSelect { ... }
.rxRadio { ... }
```

For attribute directives that do not wrap their target element, use the attribute name selector.

```css
[rx-form] { ... }
```
